<div class="container">
  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Who Is This For?</h2>
  <p><strong>Nigerians in the diaspora</strong> who miss the vibe but not the stress.<br/>
     <strong>Fans of Nigerian humor</strong> who get why "no wahala" means “huge problem.”<br/>
     People who speak fluent <em>Yoruba</em>, <em>Pidgin English</em>, <em>Hausa</em>, or just <em>street logic</em>.<br/>
     Anyone who wants to rep <strong>Naija culture</strong> with a side of sass and a full plate of attitude.
  </p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">What You’ll Find Here:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>T-shirts that say what your mama warned you not to.</li>
    <li>Mugs with quotes that hit harder than morning traffic in Lagos.</li>
    <li>Hoodies so Nigerian, they might start collecting their own ‘omo tax’.</li>
    <li>Phone cases that drop truth harder than they drop calls in the village.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Be First In Line To Laugh (and Shop)</h2>
